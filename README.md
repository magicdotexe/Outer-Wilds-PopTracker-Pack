# Outer Wilds Pack for PopTracker

This is a pack that can automatically track your items for the Outer Wilds Archipelago implementation.

## No maps?

Not yet. As someone who regularly gets lost on Timber Hearth, I would like to make them, but making 2D maps of whole-ass planets is gonna take some work. I plan to make it in the same style as the items and only showing relevant areas, but it'll be some time before it gets added.

## No story mod icons?

Not yet. I haven't played them!
The frequencies were easy to do because they all use the Signalscope. ::P

## More Info

Item icons all handmade by me!
